# DSpay

DSpay (for 'Digital-School-pay') is a system for digital payments at school or elsewhere which I am developing as my high school thesis.

DSpay has not yet been licensed, thus the [GitHub Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/) apply (section F1 specifically). This means DSpay may not be used for commercial purposes.
